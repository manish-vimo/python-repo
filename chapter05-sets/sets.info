Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data including List, Tuple, and Dictionary
Sets are unordered, but you can remove items and add new items.
Set elements are unique. Duplicate elements are not allowed.
A set itself may be modified, but the elements contained in the set must be of an immutable type.
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
You can denote a set with a pair of curly brackets {}.
