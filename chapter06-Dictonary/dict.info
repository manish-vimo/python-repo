Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable or mutable and do not allow duplicates.
Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.
A dictionary can nested and can contain another dictionary.
