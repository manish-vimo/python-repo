Branching (if, elif, else)
Branching (if, elif, else)
Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
The if/elif/else statement is used in Python for decision making.
An else statement can be combined with an if statement.
An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement
resolves to 0 or a False value
The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following
if.
The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block of code as soon
as one of the conditions evaluates to True.
Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional.
However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one statement, there can be an arbitrary number of
elif statements following an if.
